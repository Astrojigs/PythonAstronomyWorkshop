## **Welcome to the Python Astronomy Workshop!**  
This repository contains all the materials, notebooks, datasets, and exercises for a hands-on introductory course focused on using Python for astronomical data analysis. Ideal for undergraduate and graduate students—or any astronomy enthusiast—these resources combine fundamental Python programming with real astronomy applications.

## Overview

In this workshop, we will:

- Learn essential Python syntax and best practices.  
- Explore common astronomical data formats (FITS, catalogs) and how to read, process, and analyze them.  
- Use the powerful Astropy library for unit conversions, coordinate transformations, cosmological calculations, and more.  
- Visualize data with Matplotlib, plot celestial images, and fit simple models to observational data.  
- Work through real-world examples, from handling star catalogs to estimating cosmological distances.

## Who is This For?

- **Beginners to Python**: We start from the very basics, ensuring you have a strong foundation.
- **Astronomy Students**: Use Python and Astropy to apply theoretical knowledge to practical data.
- **Researchers/Enthusiasts**: Gain skills to analyze publicly available surveys (e.g., Gaia, SDSS), and integrate into your own workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of astronomical concepts (e.g., RA, Dec, magnitudes, redshift).
- A Python 3 environment. We recommend installing Python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for interactive coding sessions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/PythonAstronomyWorkshop.git
   cd PythonAstronomyWorkshop
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:  
   We recommend using a Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n astro-workshop python=3.11
   conda activate astro-workshop
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   *Make sure to include a `requirements.txt` file listing packages like `astropy`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `pandas`.*

3. **Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
   Open the notebooks in your browser and start exploring!

## Repository Structure

We suggest organizing the repository into several folders to keep materials tidy and easy to navigate:

**Folder Details:**

1. **`data/`**:  
   Contains all the datasets used throughout the workshop. This might include:
   - **`fits_files/`**: FITS images or spectral data.
   - **`csv_catalogs/`**: Astronomical catalogs (e.g., star position, magnitude lists).
   - **`example_data/`**: Small sample data for quick demonstrations.
   
2. **`notebooks/`**:  
   Jupyter notebooks with lesson content. Each notebook corresponds to a topic or a day’s session:
   - **`01_python_basics.ipynb`**: Variables, loops, functions, basic plotting.
