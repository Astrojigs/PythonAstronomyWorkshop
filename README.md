## Workshop Topics

### Lectures
The workshop covers the following topics:
1. **Basic Python for Astronomy**: Introduction to Python syntax, loops, functions, and basics of working with data.
2. **Numpy and Pandas for Astronomy**: Numerical computations, data handling, and table manipulation.
3. **Astropy Tables and FITS Files**: Reading and writing FITS files, using Astropy Tables for catalog manipulation.
4. **Visualization for Astronomy**: Creating scatter plots, histograms, and displaying FITS images with Matplotlib.
5. **Astropy Units and Coordinates**: Using units, handling celestial coordinates, and performing transformations.
6. **Cosmology with Astropy**: Working with cosmological models and computing distances, redshifts, and lookback times.
7. **Fitting and Modeling**: Curve fitting and modeling astronomical data.
8. **Time-Series and Light Curve Analysis**: Analyzing periodic signals and working with time-series data.

### Assignments
