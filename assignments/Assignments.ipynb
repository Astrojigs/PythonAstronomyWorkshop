    "## **Assignment 1: Functions, Curve Fitting, and SciPy (27th December 2024)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 1: Writing Functions**\n",
    "1. Write a Python function that calculates the distance between two celestial objects given their coordinates in the equatorial coordinate system (Right Ascension and Declination). Use the formula:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(\\delta_1) \\sin(\\delta_2) + \\cos(\\delta_1) \\cos(\\delta_2) \\cos(\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2)$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2$: Right Ascension of the objects (in degrees)\n",
    "   - $\\delta_1, \\delta_2$: Declination of the objects (in degrees)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Return the angular distance \\(\\theta\\) in degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(celestial_distance(10, 20, 30, 40))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a function that converts a Julian date to a Gregorian date. Use the formula from the prerequisites document to make the conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 2: Curve Fitting**\n",
    "1. Download a data file containing the brightness of a Cepheid variable star over time (provided: `cepheid_data.csv`).\n",
    "   - Fit a sinusoidal function to the data:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     $y(t) = A \\sin(2\\pi f t + \\phi) + C$\n",
    "     - Extract and print the parameters $A, f, \\phi,$ and $C$.\n",
    "   - Plot the data points and the fitted curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3: Numerical Integration**\n",
    "1. Using `scipy.integrate.quad`, calculate the total light emitted by a star assuming it follows a blackbody radiation curve:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $I(\\nu) = \\frac{8 \\pi h \\nu^3}{c^3} \\frac{1}{e^{h\\nu/kT} - 1}$\n",
    "   - Use $T = 5000\\,\\text{K}$ and integrate over the range $\\nu = 10^{14}$ to $\\nu = 10^{15}\\,\\text{Hz}$.\n",
    "   - Print the total intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Assignment 2: Data Importing and Analysis (28th December 2024)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 1: Working with CSV Files**\n",
    "1. Load a CSV file (`stars_catalog.csv`) containing the following columns:\n",
    "   - `star_id`, `RA`, `Dec`, `magnitude`, `spectral_type`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Perform the following tasks:\n",
    "   - Filter stars with magnitude less than 6 and save to a new CSV file (`visible_stars.csv`).\n",
    "   - Group stars by spectral type and calculate the average magnitude for each type. Save the results to a CSV file (`average_magnitude.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Plot the distribution of star magnitudes as a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 2: Working with FITS Files**\n",
    "1. Open the provided FITS file (`galaxy_data.fits`) using `astropy.io.fits`.\n",
    "   - Extract the header information and save it to a text file (`header_info.txt`).\n",
    "   - Extract the image data and plot it as a grayscale image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the FITS file contains tabular data, convert it to a Pandas DataFrame and:\n",
    "   - Filter rows where the flux is greater than 100.\n",
    "   - Plot a scatter plot of `RA` vs `Dec` for the filtered data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3: Coordinate Conversion**\n",
    "1. Write a function to convert celestial coordinates from equatorial (RA, Dec) to galactic (l, b) using the formulas in the prerequisites document.\n",
    "   - Test the function with the following values:\n",
    "     - RA: 192.25, Dec: 27.4 (Result: l ≈ 123.93, b ≈ 12.72).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply the function to the star catalog from Part 1 and add the `l` and `b` columns to the DataFrame. Save the updated catalog as `stars_catalog_galactic.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Guidelines:\n",
    "1. Each assignment should be submitted as a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) file.\n",
    "2. Include comments and explanations for each step.\n",
    "3. Provide plots and outputs wherever applicable.\n",
    "4. Upload all generated files (e.g., CSVs, images) along with the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you need sample data files or further clarification!\n"
