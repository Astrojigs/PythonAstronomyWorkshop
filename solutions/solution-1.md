# Assignment 1: Solutions and Explanations

**Note:** All code blocks here are illustrative. In an actual Jupyter notebook, you would run each code block to verify outputs.

## Part 1: Python Fundamentals

### 1. Variables and Arithmetic

**Task:**  
- Create a variable `star_distance_pc` = 2.64 parsecs.  
- Convert to light years: `star_distance_ly = star_distance_pc * 3.26`.  
- Print both distances.

**Reasoning:**  
A parsec (pc) and light year (ly) are units of distance used in astronomy. 1 pc ≈ 3.26 ly. Multiplying the parsec value by 3.26 gives the equivalent in light years.

**Code:**
```python
star_distance_pc = 2.64
star_distance_ly = star_distance_pc * 3.26

print("Distance in parsecs:", star_distance_pc, "pc")
print("Distance in light years:", star_distance_ly, "ly")
```

**Expected Output:**  
```
Distance in parsecs: 2.64 pc
Distance in light years: 8.6064 ly
```

### 2. Strings and Formatting

**Task:**  
- `star_name = "Sirius"`.  
- Print a message with the star’s name and distance in light years, formatted to 2 decimal places using an f-string.

**Reasoning:**  
F-strings allow inline formatting of numeric values. `:.2f` ensures two decimal places.

**Code:**
```python
star_name = "Sirius"
print(f"{star_name} is {star_distance_ly:.2f} light years away.")
```

**Expected Output:**  
```
Sirius is 8.61 light years away.
```

(Note that 8.6064 rounded to two decimals is 8.61.)

### 3. Lists and Loops

**Task:**  
- `magnitudes = [14.2, 13.7, 15.1, 16.0, 12.9]`  
- Print each magnitude with a `for` loop.  
- If `mag < 14.5`, print "Bright"; otherwise, print "Dim".

**Reasoning:**  
Stars’ brightness can be roughly categorized by magnitude. A lower magnitude means brighter. This is just a simple cutoff for the sake of this exercise.

**Code:**
```python
magnitudes = [14.2, 13.7, 15.1, 16.0, 12.9]

for mag in magnitudes:
    if mag < 14.5:
        print(f"Magnitude {mag} - Bright")
    else:
        print(f"Magnitude {mag} - Dim")
```

**Expected Output:**  
```
Magnitude 14.2 - Bright
Magnitude 13.7 - Bright
Magnitude 15.1 - Dim
Magnitude 16.0 - Dim
Magnitude 12.9 - Bright
```

### 4. Functions

**Task 1:** `parsec_to_ly(distance_pc)` returns distance in ly.  
We know 1 pc = 3.26 ly.

**Code:**
```python
def parsec_to_ly(distance_pc):
    return distance_pc * 3.26

# Test the function
print("2.64 pc in ly:", parsec_to_ly(2.64))
```

**Expected Output:**  
```
2.64 pc in ly: 8.6064
```

**Task 2:** `flux_to_mag(flux, flux_zero_point=3.631e-20)` converts flux to magnitude using the formula:

$$
m = -2.5 \times \log_{10}\left(\frac{\text{flux}}{\text{flux\_zero\_point}}\right)
$$

**Reasoning:**  
Magnitudes are a logarithmic measure of brightness. Using the given zero point ensures we have a reference flux to compare against.

**Code:**
```python
import math

def flux_to_mag(flux, flux_zero_point=3.631e-20):
    # Apply the given formula
    return -2.5 * math.log10(flux / flux_zero_point)

# Test with flux = 1e-19
test_flux = 1e-19
mag_result = flux_to_mag(test_flux)
print(f"For flux={test_flux}, magnitude={mag_result:.2f}")
```

**Expected Output:**  
This will depend on the calculation, but roughly:
```
For flux=1e-19, magnitude= -2.5 * log10((1e-19)/(3.631e-20))
```
Let's approximate:  
(1e-19)/(3.631e-20) ≈ 2.75 (approximately)  
log10(2.75) ≈ 0.4393  
-2.5 * 0.4393 ≈ -1.09825

So expect something around:
```
For flux=1e-19, magnitude=-1.10
```

## Part 2: Astronomically Relevant Calculations

### 1. Creating a Synthetic Catalog

**Task:**  
- `names = ["StarA", "StarB", "StarC"]`  
- `distances_pc = [1.3, 4.2, 0.5]`  
- `magnitudes = [14.2, 15.6, 13.9]`  
- For each star, print name, distance in pc, distance in ly (use `parsec_to_ly`), and magnitude.

**Reasoning:**  
We’re integrating multiple concepts: lists, indexing, a function we wrote, and string formatting.

**Code:**
```python
names = ["StarA", "StarB", "StarC"]
distances_pc = [1.3, 4.2, 0.5]
magnitudes_cat = [14.2, 15.6, 13.9]

for i in range(len(names)):
    name = names[i]
    dist_pc = distances_pc[i]
    dist_ly = parsec_to_ly(dist_pc)
    mag = magnitudes_cat[i]
    print(f"{name}: {dist_pc} pc ({dist_ly:.2f} ly), Mag: {mag}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
StarA: 1.3 pc (4.24 ly), Mag: 14.2
StarB: 4.2 pc (13.69 ly), Mag: 15.6
StarC: 0.5 pc (1.63 ly), Mag: 13.9
```

### 2. Classifying Stars by Distance

**Task:**  
- Define `classify_distance(distance_pc)`:
  - <1 pc: "Very close"
  - 1 to 5 pc: "Close"
  - >5 pc: "Far"
- Apply to each distance in `distances_pc`.

**Code:**
```python
def classify_distance(distance_pc):
    if distance_pc < 1:
        return "Very close"
    elif distance_pc <= 5:
        return "Close"
    else:
        return "Far"

for dist in distances_pc:
    classification = classify_distance(dist)
    print(f"Distance: {dist} pc -> {classification}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Distance: 1.3 pc -> Close
Distance: 4.2 pc -> Close
Distance: 0.5 pc -> Very close
```
(Note that none of these stars are >5 pc, so we don’t see "Far" here. If we had a larger distance, say 10 pc, we would see "Far".)

## Part 3: Short Exercises and Reflection

### 1. Exploring Error Handling

**Task:**  
- Try `magnitudes[10]` and observe the error.

**Explanation:**  
Our `magnitudes` list has only 5 elements indexed from 0 to 4. Trying to access index 10 is out of range. In code, this would produce an `IndexError`.

**Code (for demonstration only):**
```python
# This will cause an error!
# magnitudes[10]
```

**Error Seen:**
```
IndexError: list index out of range
```

**Explanation:**  
This error occurs because Python tries to access a list element that doesn’t exist. To fix it, ensure you only use valid indices. A common practice is to check the length of the list or use loops that iterate only over existing indices.

### 2. Reflection

*(This is a written response, no code needed.)*

**Sample Reflection:**  
"I found using functions and f-strings very straightforward, and I appreciated how Python’s string formatting makes it easy to produce readable output. One challenging part was remembering to use `:.2f` to format floats. I also learned how indexing errors occur if I try to access elements outside the list range, which is a helpful reminder to always verify list lengths. Understanding basic arithmetic, loops, and function definitions sets a solid foundation for handling more complex astronomical data."

- **Error Handling Insight:** Understanding common errors like `IndexError` helps with debugging.  
- **Astronomical Context:** Converting between units and working with magnitudes provides a taste of real astronomy workflows.

By completing this assignment, we have reinforced Python fundamentals in a context that’s relevant and practical for astronomy.
